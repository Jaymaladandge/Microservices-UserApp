Understanding Spring Proxies

In Spring Framework, when a Spring bean calls another method defined in the same bean, it does not go through the Spring 
proxy, which can cause issues with method-level annotations that rely on the proxy mechanism for aspects like transactions, 
caching, or security.

Spring uses proxies to apply aspects such as transaction management, caching, and security. These proxies intercept method 
calls on the bean and apply the relevant cross-cutting concerns defined by the annotations. There are two common types of 
proxies in Spring:

JDK Dynamic Proxies: These are used when the target class implements an interface. The proxy implements the same interface 
and delegates calls to the target bean.
CGLIB Proxies: These are used when the target class does not implement an interface. 
The proxy subclass the target class and overrides its methods to add the aspect behavior.


//the proxy mechanism only works when calls come in from some external object. When you make an internal call within the 
object, you're really making a call through the this reference, which bypasses the proxy. 


The Self-invocation Problem
When a method within the same bean calls another method annotated for a cross-cutting concern (e.g., @Transactional, @Cacheable), 
the call is a direct method invocation, bypassing the proxy. This means that the aspects are 
not applied because the proxy is not involved in the method call chain.

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Transactional
    public void methodA() {
        // Some transactional logic
        methodB(); // This call does not go through the proxy
    }

    @Transactional
    public void methodB() {
        // Some transactional logic
    }
}
When methodA is called from outside the bean, it goes through the proxy, and the transaction aspect is applied. 
However, the internal call to methodB does not go through the proxy, so the transaction aspect for methodB is not applied.


Solutions
To ensure that the aspects are applied correctly, you can use one of the following approaches:
Refactor the Logic into Separate Beans: Move the methods into separate beans so that the calls go through the proxy.

@Service
public class ServiceA {

    @Autowired
    private ServiceB serviceB;

    @Transactional
    public void methodA() {
        // Some transactional logic
        serviceB.methodB(); // This call goes through the proxy
    }
}

@Service
public class ServiceB {

    @Transactional
    public void methodB() {
        // Some transactional logic
    }
}

Use @Autowired Self-reference: Inject the bean itself and use the injected reference to make the method call, 
ensuring it goes through the proxy.
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private MyService self;

    @Transactional
    public void methodA() {
        // Some transactional logic
        self.methodB(); // This call goes through the proxy
    }

    @Transactional
    public void methodB() {
        // Some transactional logic
    }
}

The @Autowired annotation injects a proxy of the MyService bean into the self field. This means that self is not just 
a reference to the current object (this), but rather a reference to the proxy object created by Spring.


Expose the Target Class with AOP Proxy: Ensure that the bean is exposed as an AOP proxy. 
You can achieve this by using @EnableAspectJAutoProxy(proxyTargetClass=true) in your configuration class, 
forcing the use of CGLIB proxies.
@Configuration
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy(proxyTargetClass = true)
public class AppConfig {
}



even if only a single method in your entire class is annotated with @Transactional, Spring will still create 
a proxy for the entire bean. This proxy will intercept calls to that specific method
